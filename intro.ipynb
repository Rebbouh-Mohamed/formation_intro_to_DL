    "\n",
    "### How Does a Neuron Work?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron takes multiple inputs and applies two key components:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weights (\\( w \\))**: Each input is multiplied by a weight, which determines how important that input is.  \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Neural Network? 🤖  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **neural network** is just a **combination of many neurons working together**!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a single neuron, we **stack multiple neurons into layers** to create a powerful system that can learn complex functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of a Neural Network  \n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is made up of **three types of layers**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer** 🎯 – Takes in the raw data (e.g., pixels from an image, words from text).  \n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers** 🔄 – The \"thinking\" part of the network, where neurons process information and learn patterns.  \n",
    "3. **Output Layer** 🎯 – Produces the final result (e.g., predicting a number, classifying an image).  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Think of a neural network like a team of neurons working together!** Each neuron contributes a small part, and together they can approximate almost any function.  \n",

    "- **Bias** helps shift the function, allowing the network to learn patterns that wouldn’t be possible with just weights alone.  \n",

    "### Most Common Activation Functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** 🔥  \n",

    "     \\[\n",
    "     f(x) =\n",
    "     \\begin{cases} \n",
    "     x, & x > 0 \\\\\n",
    "     0, & x \\leq 0\n",

    "     \\]\n",
    "   - Simply returns the input if it's positive, otherwise outputs zero.  \n",
    "   - Helps networks learn faster and prevents unnecessary complexity.  \n",

    "2. **Sigmoid** 📉  \n",

    "     \\[\n",
    "     f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - Squashes values between **0 and 1**, making it useful for probabilities.  \n",
    "   - Used in older networks but can cause problems like vanishing gradients.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine we have an input (like an image of a cat 🐱), and we want our neural network to recognize it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens?  \n",
    "1. The input is passed through the network **layer by layer**.  \n",
    "2. Each neuron processes the input using **weights, biases, and activation functions**.  \n",
    "3. The network finally **produces an output** (e.g., \"90% chance it's a cat\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "This step is called **feedforward** because data moves **forward** through the network to make a prediction.  \n",

    "## 2️⃣ Loss Function – Measuring Error  \n",

    "To improve, we need to measure **how wrong** its predictions are.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **loss function** is a mathematical formula that tells us **how far off** the network's prediction is from the correct answer.  \n",

    "Now that we know the error, we need to **adjust the weights and biases** to improve the predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How does backpropagation work?  \n",
    "1. **The error is sent backward through the network** (backpropagation).  \n",
    "2. Each neuron **calculates its contribution to the total error**.  \n",
    "3. The weights and biases are **updated** to reduce the error.  \n",
